<h1>What is it about?</h1>

This mod enhances the vanilla weather system, fixing bugs and adding awesome new features. But that's not all, we're also introducing brand-new fancy custom weather events (coming soon).

_This mod replaces our old mod called <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/rain-should-extinguish-campfires">Rain should extinguish campfires</a>_

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Rain extinguishes campfires when they're exposed to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the night is skipped because all players sleep, the rain now continues, only the time spent sleeping is skipped.
  </li>
  <li>
    Campfires can now ignite nearby unlit campfires.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sandstorms (Soon)
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Configurable</h1>
You can pretty much enable or disable every single feature in the mod. Don't like sandstorms? Turn them off. Hate rain not skipping at sleep? Disable it. Want to remove custom items or anything else? Go for it. You can even disable everything and make the mod completely useless if that's what you're into.

<h1>Compatibility</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Lithium: Has explicit support. (mixin.world.block_entity_ticking.sleeping.campfire & mixin.alloc.chunk_random)
  </li>
</ul>
